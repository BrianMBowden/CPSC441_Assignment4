Interpretation of results:

Standard:
    Examination of the graphs from some test data would imply that colony size kept to a lower amount (14 < n < 24)
    yields the most desired results. We can observe that (given set S and Y values, as a function of colony size)  
    these colony sizes give us the most harmonious yodels and lowest silent and screechy times by comparison. 
    Small colony size tells us that most of the time the colony is sleeping (wasted traffic). Large colony size 
    tells us that most of the time is spent screechy (noisy traffic). Optimal results occur around a colony size of 
    16.

Bonus:
    Similar results as above, however, the graph tends to the left side more, so the colony size size is smaller for 
    Optimal results. Also, the the rate at which time spent screechy is a much steeper curve.
